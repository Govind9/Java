NEW DELHI:  Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has decided to scrap the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor, much criticised by commuters since its introduction in the capital seven years ago.

"The decision to scrap BRT was taken in a meeting chaired by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal," said Delhi Law Minister Kapil Mishra.

The Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government had opened the 5.8 km BRT corridor in South Delhi in 2008. This move was welcomed by environmentalists and several transport experts as a solution to Delhi's traffic problems, but many commuters complained that the system had only slowed down traffic as it was not properly regulated.

Poor management saw private vehicles cross over to the bus lane, which led to a bigger mess at intersections. Despite considerable public anger, the previous government refused to remove the BRT and tried to experiment with ways of making it work. At one point, it was opened up to private vehicles.
