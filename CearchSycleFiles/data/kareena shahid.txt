We suspect that actress Kareena Kapoor will have to brace for questions about former boyfriend Shahid Kapoor in several interviews to come. Shahid, who married Delhi girl Mira Rajput two weeks ago, and was the subject of discussion in an interview Kareena just did with Mumbai Mirror.

"I see contentment on Shahid's face. He's given some wonderful performances and is content with his career. It's a perfect time for him to get married. He wouldn't have taken this decision unless he was sure. I know he will make a wonderful husband because he is a wonderful person," she is quoted as saying in Mumbai Mirror.

Kareena and Shahid, co-stars in films like Jab We Met, dated several years ago before Kareena began dating and then married actor Saif Ali Khan.

The Mumbai Mirror report also quotes Kareena as rubbishing the pregnancy rumours that crop up every so often and saying "Acting is in my blood. Hopefully, I will act till I'm 80. I'm not ready for motherhood yet, not for two years. The day I'm ready, I won't hide it."

Kareena currently stars in Salman Khan's Bajrangi Bhaijaan and has Udta Punjab - in which Shahid also has a role - coming up.
