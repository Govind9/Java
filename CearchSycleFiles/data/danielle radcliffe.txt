Daniel Radcliffe is at it again! Last year on the “Tonight” show, the actor impressed us with his rapping skills, slaying a performance of Blackalicious' "Alphabet Aerobics." Now a new video of rapping Radcliffe has surfaced, and it is glorious! He and his girlfriend, Erin Drake, treated friends to a karaoke performance of Eminem's “The Real Slim Shady,” and we can't get enough of it. Although Radcliffe carries most of the song, the real star of the video is Erin. She bops along during the verses and chimes in during the chorus, where she screams the lyrics out the way any die-hard karaoke enthusiast would do.
