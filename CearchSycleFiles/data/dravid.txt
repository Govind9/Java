Dravid was last month appointed coach of the India A team by BCCI's high-profile advisory committee comprising retired greats Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman.
"India A is a very good platform. There are experienced players present in the current India A team. It is an exciting phase for a cricketer. I am looking forward to working with them," Dravid said here during a press conference.
Talking about wickets, he said, "It is ideal to have a wicket that provides even contest between the bat and ball. At Chepauk, we generally get good wickets that produces even contest."
Asked about the importance of bowling, the batting great said, "Success of an international team is down to getting 20 wickets. So we will be focussing on all aspects of cricket. It will be nice to find some good bowlers."
