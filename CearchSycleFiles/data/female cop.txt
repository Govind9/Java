A video of a female police officer slapping a man and giving him electric shocks in a Cairo cinema has elicited both praise and condemnation online.
The footage is compelling, even though the circumstances are far from clear. A female police officer is seen dragging a man in a yellow shirt through a crowd, into the lobby of a cinema. Once inside and away from the shouting throngs, she shouts at him, slaps him on the face and jabs him with an electric baton.
The minute-long clip on the posted on the Facebook page of the newspaper Al-Yawm al-Sabi, has been watched more than a million times. It was titled "Female police colonel teaches harasser a lesson by a beating at Cinema Metro" - although it's unclear what crime the man has committed, if any. The police officer herself, Col. Nashwa Mahmud, later indicated in an interview that she intervened in a dispute between the man and his wife. But whatever the circumstances, the video was quickly seized upon as an example of harassment - and it prompted a strong and divergent reaction on social media.
