As Salman Khan's eighth-in-a-row blockbuster continues its parallel career of shattering box office records, Bajrangi Bhaijaan director Kabir Khan spoke to NDTV about a possible third collaboration with his lead star, the pint-sized Harshaali Malhotra who has won hearts as the voiceless Munni, and the original of Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Pakistani journalist.

On Harshaali Malhotra, the film's child star: 
Kabir Khan: With each show, she is becoming bigger and bigger. The way people are reacting to her is out of control. The last time people felt this way about a child star was with Jugal Hansraj. We really worked hard to get the appropriate character. Casting director Mukesh Chhabria auditioned over a 1000 girls, even all the way in Kabul and Tehran. Harshaali is from Delhi, now living in Mumbai. She was one of 10 we selected for a workshop where she stood out not just because she looked like an angel, but for her inner drive. She wanted to do the film, she wanted to act, to perform - that makes a difference. Never seen a 6-year-old so happy to be part of the film.
