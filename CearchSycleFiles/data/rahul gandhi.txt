Rahul Gandhi renewed his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government the other day in Jaipur, with a reference to corruption allegations against BJP functionaries and even an eye-popping analogy with the film Lagaan. A pattern seems to be appearing to the Congress Vice-President's political actions after his 56-day break earlier this year. He makes shorts bursts of interventions that are loud and aggressive and aimed at capturing media space. These are interrupted by long lulls, when the day-to-day assault is carried out by his party colleagues.

There is nothing right or wrong with this approach; it is simply the path Rahul and the Congress have chosen. Perhaps the party recognises that its would-be President doesn't quite have the stamina to sustain a long-drawn engagement and will only make what one Congress functionary called "guerrilla" appearances. What is remarkable is that Rahul's essential argument continues to be exactly what it was before May 16, 2014: he is the voice of the poor and the underprivileged, the peasant and the underdog; Modi is the representative of the rich. That neat binary has not been disturbed, even if it didn't quite work in the previous Lok Sabha election.
