At every Wimbledon win, World's No.1 Tennis Player Novak Djokovic bends down to pluck out blades of grass off the turf to eat them. And while we all know this is the Serbian legend's traditional victory celebration- something he had always wanted to do as a young boy if he were to ever win the Wimbledon- it also quickly reminds us of the much-talked -about dieting habits that put Djokovic on the path to success- something he likes to call his 'game changer'.

His Gluten-Free Diet

This low-carb diet was no less than a godsend for young Djokovic who would not be able to make it through a single game without collapsing due to tight chest pains, stomach spasms and breathing difficulties- back when he was unaware of his gluten allergy. Having started playing tennis at the age of 6, this champion had progressed level after level from war-torn Serbia to the international Tennis arena only to discover that he might lose his career to medical issues  before it had even begun. Upon detecting the culprit, Djokovic did not shy away from completely overhauling his diet. "I had to listen to my body. Once I did, everything changed. You could call it magic", says Novak in his book Serve To Win, on the subject of being gluten-free.
