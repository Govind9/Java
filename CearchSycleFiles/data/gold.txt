London: Gold was on the brink of five-year lows on Tuesday, with more losses expected in the coming months following Monday's "bear raid" when sellers dumped an estimated 33 tonnes in just two minutes.

The sudden bout of selling in Shanghai and New York occurred during illiquid trading hours, with a wave of orders placed during a one-minute period shortly after the Shanghai Gold Exchange opened on Monday.

Within a further minute, the deals had been completed, sending the most-active US gold futures contract down $48 to as low as $1,080.00 per ounce - its weakest since February 2010. Gold worth $1.3 billion changed hands on the Chinese and US markets on Monday, and the lack of liquidity on a day when Japanese markets were closed for a holiday hastened the slide.

Spot gold stood at $1,104.50 per ounce at 1348 GMT (7:18 p.m. in India) on Tuesday, with another 29 tonnes worth about $1.02 billion changing hands on the Shanghai exchange during the day. That was almost double the exchange's 16 tonne average daily volume last month.

Monday's move has left the market vulnerable to further slippage - possibly paving the way toward $1,000 per ounce.

Many investors analyse charts of previous market moves to decide their strategy, with prices hitting resistance at certain levels as they rise, or finding support as they fall.

In this case, traders and analysts are speculating that at least one major fund took advantage of the thin market to push the gold price through a support level on the charts, possibly because they had already sold gold short. Chinese entities were seen as the most likely sellers on Monday.
