NEW DELHI:  The union government has pushed the button on a likely confrontation with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa by asking the Supreme Court not to show any mercy to the killers of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

"This was a brutal incident in which 18 persons died and over 200 sustained injuries and the killers deserve no sympathy or mercy," said the Centre's lawyer, Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, following the line taken by the earlier Congress-led government.

The Tamil Nadu government, headed by J Jayalalithaa, wants to free seven people convicted for the 1991 assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by a suicide bomber from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The separatist militant group's fight for ethnic Tamils in Sri Lanka is an emotive issue in Tamil Nadu.
