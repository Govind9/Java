Samsung Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7: First Impressions by Robin Sinha, 17 July 2015





Samsung, as most of us guessed already, introduced its new J Series in India with the launch of Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 on Thursday. The smartphones, which have been available in China since last month, fit into the mid-range segment based on their low prices, but offer impressive specifications and features. While the smaller Samsung Galaxy J5 is priced at Rs. 11,999, its larger sibling, the Galaxy J7, will set you back by Rs. 14,999. 

Both are Flipkart exclusives for now and are available to pre-order, but will ship on July 24. The two new phones are also positioned by Samsung as affordable devices for gamers as they can potentially deliver smooth online gaming experiences using 4G LTE connectivity. Notably however, the models launched do not support TDD-LTE Band 40 (2300MHz) for 4G LTE in India, and only the FDD-LTE Band 3 (1800MHz) that has yet to see a rollout in the country.
