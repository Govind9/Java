After boasting of a tennis court high up in the air built atop the 1,000-foot-tall Burj al Arab hotel, Dubai has wooed an architect to test the waters for an underwater tennis court. Polish architect Krysztof Kotala has proposed to build an underwater tennis complex located offshore in the Persian Gulf, between the Burj al Arab and the Palm Jumeirah islands.

The sports arena will also double up as an aquarium with a rooftop coral reef, which will put on display an abundance of sea life for spectators as well as players. Conceived to create an illusion of a natural atoll, once made, the glass covered court will add up to Dubai’s stunning record-breaking shoreline. However, engineers and developers have voiced apprehensions about building the underwater arena as it poses many challenges which, at the moment, seem impossible to overcome.
