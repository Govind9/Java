The world of motorsport has bid farewell to French Formula 1 driver Jules Bianchi at his funeral in his hometown of Nice.
World champion Lewis Hamilton and many of Bianchi's colleagues joined family and friends at a service in the city's cathedral while fans gathered outside.
The 25-year-old died on Friday from head injuries he sustained in a crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.
His car number, 17, is being retired from F1 in his honour.
Bianchi had been in a coma since crashing his Marussia car into a recovery vehicle at a rain-hit race last October.
He is the first F1 driver to die from injuries sustained in a grand prix since Brazilian triple world champion Ayrton Senna was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994.
