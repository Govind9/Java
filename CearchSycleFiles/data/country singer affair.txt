Ever since news broke of Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton's shocking split, rumors have swirled as to what led country music's king and queen to call it quits.

The country singer named by multiple reports as having an affair with Lambert took to Twitter on Tuesday to deny the cheating allegations.

"I don't normally address gossip but in this case I will," singer Chris Young wrote on Twitter. "My name has been mentioned as a contributing factor in Blake and Miranda's divorce. That is totally FALSE. They are both my friends and I would not betray that friendship. Just wanted to clear that up."

Just hours after the pair announced their divorce, rumors circulated that infidelity-- on Lambert's part-- was to blame for the seemingly sudden split up.

A TMZ report, citing sources, claims that Shelton had learned that Lambert was unfaithful with Young, and he subsequently filed for divorce. The gossip site reports it was the second time Shelton had suspected his wife cheating on him. The site claims Shelton had suspected Lambert was involved with Young and more recently that she was sneaking around with another man, who was not famous.

Shelton's infidelity has been at the heart of tabloid rumors since their 2011 union. However, current media reports cite sources claiming Shelton has been faithful to Lambert throughout their marriage and has been focusing on work since they split. Some fans believe the "Sangria" singer's PR team has been hard at work to paint the divorce in Shelton's favor.
