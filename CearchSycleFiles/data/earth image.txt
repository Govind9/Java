WASHINGTON:  Clicked from 1.6 million kms away in space, a NASA camera on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite has returned its first stunning view of the entire sun-lit side of Earth.

DSCOVR is equipped with the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) that took the new photo on July 6.

EPIC captures a series of 10 different images in a variety of wavelengths, from near infrared to ultraviolet light, which can be analyzed in a number of different ways.

"Just got this new blue marble photo from ?@NASA. A beautiful reminder that we need to protect the only planet we have," US President Barack Obama tweeted on his official @POTUS handle.
