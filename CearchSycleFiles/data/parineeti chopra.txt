A day after Bollywood actress Parineeti Chopra was announced as the brand ambassador for the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao campaign by the Haryana government, state Health Minister Anil Vij on July 17 expressed ignorance on the subject.

In comments that may cause embarrassment to the ruling BJP state government, Mr Vij said that he was not informed about the decision by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

"I do not have any information about anybody being appointed brand ambassador of my department for Beti Bachao programme," Mr Vij tweeted after Parineeti was named as the brand ambassador of the programme to promote the cause of girl child. Parineeti, 26, originally hails from Ambala.

The controversy has yet again brought to fore the blow-hot blow-cold relations between the health minister and the chief minister.

"I came to know through the social media that some actress has been made brand ambassador. Many of my friends in the media tried to seek information from me regarding the terms and conditions of her appointment, after which I tweeted to clarify things from my side," Mr Vij told reporters after his tweet erupted into a controversy.

The five-time MLA maintained that the issue of the actress being made as the brand ambassador was never discussed in any of the meetings of his department. "Nor has my department any knowledge about it," he added.

Mr Vij also clarified that there was no need for any celebrity to run the campaign.
