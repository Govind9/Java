Mourners wept, shouted slogans and clutched the coffins as they were lined up in the courtyard of a mosque.
They were then taken to their home towns for burial.
Turkey's PM says the authorities have identified the suspected bomber, who is thought to have had links with the Islamic State (IS) group.
The activists, mainly university students, were members of the Federation of Socialist Youth Associations.
They were holding a news conference when the bomb ripped through Soruc's Amara Cultural Centre on Monday afternoon. They had been planning to travel to Syria to help rebuild the town of Kobane.
