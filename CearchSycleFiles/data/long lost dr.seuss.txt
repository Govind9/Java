It’s turning out to be a summer full of long-lost books being released. First it was Harper Lee’s manuscript, “Go Set a Watchman,” a prequel to the much-beloved “To Kill a Mockingbird.” And now it’s a recently discovered new work from Dr. Seuss. That’s right, Dr. Seuss (also known as Theodor Seuss Geisel) is returning with a new book, “What Pet Should I Get?,” 25 years after his last published work, “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” Geisel’s widow, Audrey Geisel, found the manuscript in 2013, along with black-and-white illustrations done by Dr. Seuss himself. The new book features some familiar faces, such as the children from the classic book, “One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish.” “What Pet Should I Get?” comes out on July 28, and we can’t wait to see what pet these kids get!
