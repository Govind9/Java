Instagram was left red-faced Monday after it was forced to apologize for shutting down the account of a user and handing it to a famous soccer player with the same name.

Taking to his blog to explain the bizarre episode, the not-famous Andrés Iniesta wrote, "My name is Andrés Iniesta and my only mistake was having the exact name and last name as a famous football player."

The famous Iniesta plays for Barcelona and Spain, and he, or his PR team, recently decided to open an Instagram account.

Non-famous Iniesta, who lives in Madrid, continues the story: "I am a father who likes to take pictures of his kids, yummy food and interesting buildings in Madrid. I usually share them on Instagram with friends and family.

"But four days ago and without previous notice, Instagram decided to close my account. The reason was that I 'infringed the Terms of Use.'"

Confused, Iniesta examined the photo-sharing site's list of terms and conditions, but couldn't for the life of him work out what he'd done wrong.

He sent Instagram a message asking for an explanation, but heard nothing back. The situation became a little clearer when some friends contacted him to say the soccer star had mysteriously appeared on their "following" list. "And they don't even like football!" Iniesta wrote.

He contacted Instagram again, but once again, nothing came back.
