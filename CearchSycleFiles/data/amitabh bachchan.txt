Filmmaker R Balki revealed his upcoming movie, which has Arjun Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor Khan in the lead, will have a "very special appearance" by megastar Amitabh Bachchan.

The yet untitled film will pair Arjun opposite the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actress for the first time.

"I will start shooting my next with Kareena and Arjun soon. It has Mr Bachchan in it. He is doing a very special appearance in the film. Without his appearance the film will not be possible," Balki told PTI.

The director, who is an ardent fan of Mr Bachchan, has worked with the actor in all the films - Cheeni Kum, Paa and his latest Shamitabh, which failed to create a buzz at the box office.
