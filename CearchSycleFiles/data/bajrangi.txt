The film starts with a Muslim family watching TV in Sultanpur village, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and an expectant mother's (Meher Vij) baby kicks when Shahid Afridi leads Pakistan to victory in an India–Pakistan cricket match. A few years later, the baby has grown up to be a young speech-impaired girl Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra). Her mother(Meher Vij) takes her to Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya's Dargah in Delhi, India to pray for her speech being returned.

Unfortunately Shahida gets lost in India with no way to head back over the border to her home, and boards a freight train, and reaches Kurukshetra, India. In Kurukshetra, a brahmin devout Shri Hanuman Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi also known as Bajrangi (Salman Khan) is dancing merrily with other worshippers. Shahida spots and follows Bajrangi, and gets associated with him under strange circumstances. He assumes she's Hindu and separated from her parents. He buys her a Bajrang Bali pendant to protect her from harm.

On his way to Delhi, Bajrangi quizzes the little girl, and calls him Munni to find out which city she's from, but she doesn't respond to any Indian town names. Bajrangi meets Rasika (Kareena Kapoor) on the bus in Delhi where he insists they split change over a ticket. She tries to shake him off but finds him in her own haveli, advising her father on how to wrestle. Rasika thinks Bajrangi has come there to harass her but it turns out her father is Dayan
