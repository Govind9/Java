Whenever singing becomes a part of a maid of honor speech, it really could go either way. But these two California sisters have schooled all the bridesmaids who came before them with an epic musical wedding toast. Kelsey and Maddie Hallerman broke it down to a medley of songs at their sister Caitlin’s wedding, rewriting all the lyrics to reflect the story of Caitlin and her husband, John. From Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me One Reason” to the Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back” to the Backstreet Boys “Everybody,” we think they covered all the bases. The idea came to the two sisters as they listened to music in a car together shortly after Caitlin got engaged. “Now, to know Caitlin is to know of her undying love for MJ, Tracy Chapman, Whitney, and Mariah (which we didn’t dare to attempt), and we just knew incorporating some [of] these songs would be the best way to represent her,” Kelsey told ABC. The bride and groom were obviously impressed, and the sisters received a standing ovation from the crowd for their performance. Good luck topping that, future bridesmaids!
